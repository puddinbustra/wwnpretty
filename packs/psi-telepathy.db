If the psychic has the requisite body parts to speak the target’s language, they can communicate with it in turn.</p><p>Level-2: The psychic’s awareness of the target’s surface cognition is sophisticated enough to read their current thoughts, though it can’t pick up memories or non-obvious connections. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist this.</p><p>Level-3: The psychic can drill down into the target’s memory to get a one or two-sentence answer to any single question they ask, or receive a single answering vision of the target’s recollections.

At the table, up to five minutes of discussion and coordination among the players can be arranged each round without incurring delays for the PCs. Every combat turn, one gestalt member of the psychic’s choice gets an extra round of action to represent the benefits of the perfect coordination of the group.
