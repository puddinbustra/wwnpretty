{"_id":"8d3TIOYtaXrIzvl3","data":{"bundle":{"amount":1,"bundled":false},"cost":100,"description":"Line shunt: These palm-sized discs are roughly one centimeter in thickness, with an adhesive side that will stick to virtually anything and a polychromatic phased compound on its shell which will shift color to blend with its surroundings. One or more line shunts must be applied at specific locations within a site to access the more well-defended varieties of computerized systems. Shunts employ phased energy manipulation tech, and so do not need to be directly in contact with a data line but only within a few centimeters. Line shunts are single-use, and keep functioning until removed.","encumbrance":0,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Line shunt","type":"item"}
{"_id":"Mj94FAUsk9PeLSgI","data":{"bundle":{"amount":1,"bundled":false},"cost":1000,"description":"Tightbeam link unit: Much like a remote link unit, a tightbeam unit uses a laser to connect via lineof-sight transmission. Unlike a remote link unit, there’s almost no chance for a conventional security system to detect this link, but it requires that the infiltrators get a clear line of sight between the unit and the receiving end. Commercial satellite reception units can be employed for skyward aiming at 500 credits/hour if a second land unit is unavailable, but indoor use is impossible.","encumbrance":1,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Tightbeam link unit","type":"item"}

{"_id":"ViwV1dT0bWTjr0kd","data":{"bundle":{"amount":1,"bundled":false},"cost":0,"description":"Stiletto charge: These ancient Mandate-era polymorphic intrusion charges were originally made to allow Mandate agents to easily overcome primitive colonial data security measures. Each charge is a small interface plug the size of a human thumb. When used as part of a hack against a TL4 system, it causes the skill check to automatically succeed regardless of the difficulty. Without line shunts, however, the duration of the hack is still no more than the usual 1d4 rounds plus the hacker’s Program skill. These devices are single-use, and are prized so highly that they are almost always unavailable for conventional purchase. Favors to the right people and the looting of Mandate remnants are the only normal ways to acquire these devices.","encumbrance":1,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":5},"name":"Stiletto charge","type":"item"}

Two of these links can allow a user to maintain contact with a remote data storage unit. The connection is too “stiff” to allow for easy hacking, however, and it applies a -2 penalty to any attempts to hack through it.

They function as a metatool for purposes of accessing data lines and grant a +1 bonus to all hacking attempts made with them. They are also quite illegal on most worlds, available only from black market dealers and private sales from hackers.","encumbrance":1,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Black slab","type":"item"}

This standard TL4 storage unit is a portable but clumsy case hardened against anything short of intentional damage with a firearm, capable of interfacing with a wide variety of hardware to receive and upload data. A single storage unit can hold a tremendous amount of data that has been carefully compressed and optimized for it. If the user is simply ripping a database off a network and stuffing it into the unit, it can absorb up to a small corporation’s complete files.","encumbrance":3,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Storage unit","type":"item"}
