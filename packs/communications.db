The translations are eccentric in many cases, and there is always a several-second delay between each statement and its translation. Any attempts to exert social skills or Charisma through a translator torc suffer a -2 skill check penalty. The torc is powered by one type A power cell, which lasts for one week of regular use.","encumbrance":0,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Translator torc","type":"item"}
