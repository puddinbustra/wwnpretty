The usual variety can be detonated by radio signals, timers, or electrical charges, and inflict their damage on any objects within twenty meters, with an Evasion saving throw for half damage. Victims within forty meters take half damage, with an Evasion save for none. The charge is sufficient to blow a four-meter wide hole in anything short of a reinforced wall. PCs with a background in demolitions or Fix-0 skill can shape the charge so it directs the blast in only one direction, sparing all but two meters of the rest.","encumbrance":1,"location":"other","quality":"stock","range":{"max":40,"normal":20},"secondStat":"none","shock":{"ac":15,"dmg":0},"skill":"","stat":"-","tl":3},"name":"Demo Charge","type":"weapon"}

Each successful hit on a target allows the gunner to roll damage once, but only the highest damage roll is applied to the target.
