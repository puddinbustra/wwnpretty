A telekinetic user pushes a resistance bar within the generator, causing a flow of electricity to recharge an attached power cell. Any telekinetic with Telekinesis-1 skill or better can recharge a cell with fifteen minutes of concentration. In an emergency, a character with at least Strength 10 can operate the generator manually, though they need to succeed on a difficulty 8 Con/Exert skill check in order to keep up the pace for an hour. Failure means that the character must rest for at least an hour before trying again. The generator can charge one type A power cell at a time. Communications Almost all TL4 worlds have a planetary communications grid compatible with any standard compad. Some planets are less technologically gifted, however, or have local conditions that preclude easy wireless communication. Other times, the PCs have reason to avoid leaving call logs that might come back to haunt them.","encumbrance":2,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Telekinetic generator","type":"item"}
