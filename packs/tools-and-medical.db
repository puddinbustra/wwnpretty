If the patch is applied to a character that has fallen to 0 hit points, the user can make an Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check against difficulty 6 to stabilize the subject. The more time between injury and application, the less chance the patch has to work. Each round after the first, an additional -1 penalty is applied to the skill check. The patch is no use after six rounds. If the medic fails the first skill check, they can keep trying the check once per round until the victim is revived or time runs out. Lazarus patches are no use on victims that have died of disease, poison, or have been mangled beyond surgical repair by Heavy weapons or similar trauma. Only one patch can be applied to a victim. Revived victims are critically wounded until sufficient medical help has been tendered; see the Systems chapter for details.","encumbrance":1,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Lazarus patch","type":"item"}

A unit of spare parts can also be used to jury-rig some basic, uncomplicated tool or weapon from the equipment list with ten or fifteen minutes of assembly and at least Fix-0 skill.
