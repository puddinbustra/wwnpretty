{"_id":"7VomXrIyYao0nJwG","data":{"bundle":{"amount":1,"bundled":false},"cost":100,"description":"Reverie (Heal-1): This very dangerous combat drug completely subdues the subject’s fear centers and adrenaline production, leaving them perfectly calm and relaxed even in the midst of mortal danger. Their reaction speed is much slower as a consequence, and they may act only on even-numbered combat rounds; so on the second, fourth, and sixth rounds and so forth. Any damage they suffer is doubled as well due to their lack of vigilance. Their perfect calm allows them to shoot as if on the target range, however, and they can make Dex/Shoot skill checks to hit a target instead of hit rolls; the difficulty is 7 at point blank, 9 at normal ranges, and 11 at long ranges for the weapon. The target’s Armor Class is ignored. Melee attacks made under Reverie always hit. Reverie lasts for ten minutes and adds 2 System Strain to the target.","encumbrance":0,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Reverie","type":"item"}

The subject must be immobilized or willing to be affected by it. For five minutes afterwards they will be unable to avoid answering questions about facts known to them; they will be unable to exercise anything resembling a hypothesis or a judgment, but they will answer specific questions about facts known to them truthfully. Unwilling victims can attempt a Physical saving throw; on a success, they can simply refuse to speak about one particular topic of their choice. Targets pass out for 1d6 hours after the drug wears off and are immune to it for a week thereafter.","encumbrance":0,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":4},"name":"Squeal","type":"item"}

A Hush dose lasts for an hour plus three per Heal level of the person applying the stim, and the subject retains no memories while under the effect.
