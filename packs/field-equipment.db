{"_id":"2CBbiwqq0wWQACPV","data":{"bundle":{"amount":1,"bundled":false},"cost":1000,"description":"Vacc suit: The standard TL4 vacc suit is designed to allow the wearer to survive in both hard vacuum and on most inhospitable planetary surfaces. The suit protects against ordinary levels of cosmic radiation and provides a temperature-controlled atmosphere. Vacc suits are equipped with radios that have a ten-kilometer range. A vacc suit oxygen tank weighs 1 encumbrance, included with the weight of the suit, and functions for six hours. Vacc suits are cumbersome, and apply a -2 penalty to all hit rolls and skill checks that require movement. Those with at least a month of zero-gee experience can ignore this penalty. No armor can be worn with a vacc suit, though the suit itself grants AC 13 to its wearers. A vacc suit requires one type A power cell for each twelve hours of operation. Vacc suits have a self-healing exterior that can seal the puncture wounds caused by bullets, arrows, or energy beams, but a strike from an edged weapon can overwhelm the repair system. If a character with 10 or fewer hit points is struck by an edged weapon, there is a 50% chance the suit is torn. Suits are equipped with emergency repair patches, but it requires a Main Action to apply one. Exposure to vacuum is described on page 58.","encumbrance":1,"location":"other","quality":"stock","tl":5},"name":"Vacc skin","type":"item"}
