# Installing
This is not the official system for WWN:R, so you will have to manually install this one. To install,
click 'install system' in Foundry, and then submit this system's manifest: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puddinbustra/wwnpretty/main/system.json

# About

This sheet is for Stars Without Number: Revised edition. 
Since I homebrew a lot of my own content for my own games, I may not add features I don't use - like item compendiums - unless there is significant interest in me doing so.

# Why This Sheet?

Pros | Cons
------------ | -------------
Pretty | No ships, vehicles
Most stats are automated (AC, strain, etc) | No compendiums
Familiar for 5e sheet users
Room everywhere for notes

# Contact
If you have any other feedback, be it suggestions or support, send me a message on discord - lofty#8637, or an email at kvrosevelt@gmail.com. If people are enjoying it, I'll be more likely to add more features.

# Compatability
Since this is mostly based off of the 5e character sheet, many of the modules compatible with that should require minimal changes to function here. Stuff like token modules, map modules, and chat modules should work. 
For example, Crash's autohide rolls work after a few adjustments (I can share my changes if anyone wants to use this module).

# Possible Additions
- Vehicles
- Ships
- Compendiums (if anyone wants to make and export these themselves, I'll add them to the repo)

# Impending Improvements
- Automate the 'other' ability modifier (will require making a shown vs final attribute)


# Maintaining Code
As long as I am playing this system, I will be maintaining the sheet, which will be at least all of 2021, and hopefully long after. 
When I stop playing, how well I maintain the code will depend on whether other people are using it. Major foundry updates 
will probably break the character sheets, so you may want to wait until the sheet is updated for it before you download the 
new Foundry versions.
